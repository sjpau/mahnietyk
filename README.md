# MAHNIETYK
Mahnietyk is a small videogame created for Ebiten Game Jam.
### Installation
In order to compile the game yourself you need to install the dependencies first.
* github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten - Ebitengine library for creating GUIs in Go
* github.com/hajimehoshi/oto - Low-level audio playing library
* github.com/solarlune/goaseprite - Aseprite JSON parser for Ebitengine

Use `go get [dependency]` to install them.
After it's done use `go install github.com/theonlymoby/mahnietyk@latest`

Should any issues occur you can also use `go get github.com/theonlymoby/mahnietyk` and build manually `go build main.go`
